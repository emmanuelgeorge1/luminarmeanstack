git clone:- open your git acc on browser then click "create repository", type name and then crate it 
so this crated git clone will be avaliable to the local repository

so if we crate a local program it will only be avaliable to us if we need to add it to the git hub then we must use "git push"
then that file will be avaliable to anyone if we made that public, but inorder for other machine to access this program it need to perform 
operation called "git pull"


local storage ==> stageing area ==> local repository ==> remote repository
      



command for initialize:= git init                              

command for listing and untracked file:= git status

command for adding all untracked file to stageing area:= git add -A
